# Security

Razorpay takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our Razorpay organizations and looks forward to working with the security community to find vulnerabilities and protect our businesses and customers. We are dedicated to responsibly resolving any security concerns.

Our [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/razorpay) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards. However, we will ensure that your finding (if valid), is accepted and gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Razorpay owned repository, please report it to us through our [Hackerone program](https://hackerone.com/razorpay).

Please refrain from disclosing vulnerabilities via public channels such as issues, discussions, or pull requests.
